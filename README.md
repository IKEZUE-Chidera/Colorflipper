### **Color Flipper Project Overview**

In the **Color Flipper project**, the goal is to create a simple web application that changes the background color of the body when a button is clicked. The project will have two setups:

1. **Fixed Color Setup**:
   - A predetermined array of specific colors will be used.
  
2. **Hex Color Setup**:
   - Generates unique hex colors on the fly, providing an infinite number of color options.

### **Project Steps**:
- **HTML Structure**:
  - Start by creating an `index.html` file.
  - Include a **navbar** to navigate between the simple and hex color pages.
    - The navbar will contain links to `index.html` and a future `hex.html`.
  - Add a **main** element that contains:
    - A title to display the current background color.
    - A button to trigger the color change, which will have two CSS classes and an ID for targeting in JavaScript.
    - A heading that indicates the background color and a span to show the current color value, initially set to gray.
    - 
This project serves as a great introduction to handling user interactions and manipulating styles dynamically with JavaScript.
